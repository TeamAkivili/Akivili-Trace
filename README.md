Open Source Observability for LLM applications

## Open Source & Open Telemetry(OTEL) Observability for LLM applications

---

Langtrace is an open source observability software which lets you capture, debug and analyze traces and metrics from all your applications that leverages LLM APIs, Vector Databases and LLM based Frameworks.

## Open Telemetry Support

The traces generated by Langtrace adhere to [Open Telemetry Standards(OTEL)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/). We are developing [semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/semantic-conventions/) for the traces generated by this project. You can checkout the current definitions in [this repository](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace-trace-attributes/tree/main/schemas). Note: This is an ongoing development and we encourage you to get involved and welcome your feedback.

## Getting Started


### Built using python

```python
pip install langtrace-python-sdk
```

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
langtrace.init(api_key=<your_api_key>)
```

OR

```python
from langtrace_python_sdk import langtrace
langtrace.init() # LANGTRACE_API_KEY as an ENVIRONMENT variable
```

### Langtrace self hosted

To run the Langtrace locally, you have to run three services:

- Next.js app
- Postgres database
- Clickhouse database

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Checkout our [documentation](https://docs.langtrace.ai/hosting/overview) for various deployment options and configurations.

Requirements:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

#### The .env file

Feel free to modify the `.env` file to suit your needs.

#### Starting the servers

```bash
docker compose up
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Take down the setup

To delete containers and volumes

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

`-v` flag is used to delete volumes
